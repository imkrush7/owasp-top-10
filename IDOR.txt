
Insecure Direct Object Reference
---------------------------------
---------------------------------

	IDOR is a permission-based vulnerability which allows an attacker to access or modify resources belonging to other users of the web application.

	Insecure Direct Object References allow attackers to bypass authorization and access resources directly by modifying the value
	of a parameter that used to directly point to an object

	The basic fundamental behind IDOR is that an endpoint of a web application tries to display or modify some resource such as a profile, image, or file using a 
	user-supplied identifire in the request but doesn't check whether the user has enough permission to accomplish the task.


mitigation
-----------
	if the users are allowed to access only their profile, we can use the logged-in user’s ID in the session to locate it, 
	thus eliminating the need for passing id as a URL parameter.
