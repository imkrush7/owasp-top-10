--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------


This kind of threat occurs when the components such as libraries and frameworks used within the app almost always execute with full privileges. 
If a vulnerable component is exploited, it makes the hacker’s job easier to cause a serious data loss or server takeover.

	Developers usually focus on securing their own code and often forget about the code they have imported from others. 
	In many cases developers are not even aware of all the code that is running. 
	This is mainly due to plugins which in turn import libraries which in turn have their own dependencies etc.



Exploitability
---------------

When a vulnerability is published on the internet, someone often uploads a ready to use payload which an attacker could simply download and use against the target. 
This means that an attacker can use it towards the site without even knowing how and why it works.



How to discover
----------------

	The first step is to identify all components that are being used and could possibly be vulnerable, i.e. the ones that somehow process user data. 
	This includes web servers, operating systems, plugins and everything in between.

	The next step is to look up every component for vulnerabilities and exploits. 
	The first step would be to use Google to search for this, and then proceed to look into different vulnerabilities and exploit databases.



Remediation
------------

	The first step to get rid of vulnerabilities in the components you are using would be to always keep everything up to date. 
	Build the system in a way that allows security patches to be installed in a timely manner.

	Be careful when external components, plugins, softwares or even the dependencies of those plugins are used. 
	Make sure that everything fulfils the requirements that have been set for custom code regarding regularly maintenance, passing security tests, etc.
