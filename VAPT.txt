-------------------------------------------------

What is Vulnerability Assessment?
----------------------------------
	A vulnerability assessment (VA) is a systematic technical approach to find the security loop holes in a network or software system. 
	VA is entirely a process of searching and finding, with an objective that none of the loop holes are missed. 
	It primarily adopts a scanning approach which is performed by using tools as well as manually. 
	The outcome of a VA process is report showing all vulnerabilities, which are categorized based on their severity. 
	This report is further used for the next step which is penetration testing. 
	VA is usually a non-intrusive process and can be carried out without jeopardizing the IT infrastructure or application’s operations.


What is Penetration Testing?
-----------------------------
	A penetration test (PT) is a proof-of-concept approach to actually explore and exploit a vulnerability. 
	This process ensures that the vulnerability really exists and further such exploitation can result into an impactful damage to the application or network. 
	The PT process is mostly intrusive and can actually cause damage to the systems, hence a lot of precaution needs to be taken before planning such a test. 
	The outcome of a PT is typically an evidence in the form of a screen-shot or log which substantiates the finding and can be a useful aid towards the fixation. 

	As a summary, below are the steps entailed in the VAPT process.
		1. Scan the network or application
		2. Search for security flaws		
		3. Exploit the security flaws
		4. Prepare report



Difference between VA and PT
-----------------------------
	VA can be carried out using automated tools, while a PT in almost all cases is a manual process. 
	This is because PT essentially simulates what real hackers would do to your network or application. 
	Refer to the diagrams showing VAPT process for network and web applications.

A false positive is when a vulnerability actually does not exist but it is reported.
